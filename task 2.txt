What is HTTP? Why is HTTP/2 faster than HTTP/1.1?
HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol, and it is the basis for almost all web applications. More specifically, HTTP is the method computers and servers use to request and send information. 
For instance, when someone navigates to cloudflare.com on their laptop, their web browser sends an HTTP request to the Cloudflare servers for the content that appears on the page. Then, Cloudflare servers send HTTP responses with the text, images, and formatting that the browser displays to the user.

The first usable version of HTTP was created in 1997. Because it went through several stages of development, this first version of HTTP was called HTTP/1.1. This version is still in use on the web. In 2015, a new version of HTTP called HTTP/2 was created.

HTTP/2 solves several problems that the creators of HTTP/1.1 did not anticipate. In particular, HTTP/2 is much faster and more efficient than 
HTTP/1.1. One of the ways in which HTTP/2 is faster is in how it prioritizes content during the loading process.
HTTP/2 allows clients to make multiple requests over one TCP connection while HTTP/1.1 allows only one request (even with request pipelining).

Therefore, HTPP/2 will help to improve concurrency and reduce latency.

There are several other advantages of HTTP/2:

Being fully multiplexed: i.e server can “push” response back to client. Current practices to achieve this behavior is using long-polling or via WebSocket.
Having reduced request size with HPACK (header compression), with efficient coding for HTTP header fields and reduced round trip times (RTT).
Allowing request prioritization: more important requests get completed faster.
In short, HTTP/2 helps to boost network performance (reduced total number of TCP connections, faster RTT, less resource consumptions) while still supporting all core features of HTTP/1.1
